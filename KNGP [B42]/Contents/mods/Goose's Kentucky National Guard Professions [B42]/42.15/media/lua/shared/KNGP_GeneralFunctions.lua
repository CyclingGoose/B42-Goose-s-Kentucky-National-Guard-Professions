-- "An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity. An idiot, the more complicated something is, the more he will admire it.
-- If you make something so clusterfucked he can't understand it, he's gonna think you're a god because you made it so complicated, nobody can understand it.
-- That's how they write academic journals. They try to make it so complicated people think they're a genius."
